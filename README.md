# SwiftUI Sample with Forage iOS SDK

This sample app demonstrates how to integrate the Forage iOS SDK into your SwiftUI application to process EBT payments.

Forage iOS SDK is built upon UIKit. You can integrate ForageSDK using `UIViewRepresentable` in your SwiftUI code.

Check the [official Apple tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/interfacing-with-uikit) to learn more about adapting UIKit views for SwiftUI.

> NOTE: This demo is just an example of how UIKit views from Forage SDK can be integrated into your SwiftUI application. Forage doesn't have official SwiftUI support yet.
